Pan-Tilt stack
==============

Is used to control ATRVjr's Directed Perception ptu46 unit.


Origins
==============

The stack is a copy of Washington University Pan/Tilt stack hosted at
https://wu-robotics.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stable/wu_ptu
The initial copy was made at svn revision r2226.
The wu_ptu stack then was imported into git, maintaining all the history.

There are two reasons for creating the copy:
* convenience of git;
* ability to fix things faster;
